# physics_test
 Rapier3D + BablyonJS test

To run:
`tinybuild`

or `npm i -g tinybuild & tinybuild` if you don't have it installed.

Rapier3D: fancy Rust -> JS WASM physics engine, it's faster than anything else free.

Benchmarks: https://www.dimforge.com/blog/2020/08/25/announcing-the-rapier-physics-engine/

BabylonJS: fancy JS rendering engine, including lots of extras. Little fatter than ThreeJS but heavier on game engine features.
